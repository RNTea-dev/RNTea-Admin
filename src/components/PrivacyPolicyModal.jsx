                    The use of "Legitimate Interest" as a lawful basis is subject to a strict balancing test under the GDPR. A data controller must demonstrate that its interests in processing the data (e.g., security, service improvement) are not overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Data Subject. This requires a formal assessment and is a point of frequent legal scrutiny. In this model, we assert that the processing of technical data for security purposes is a legitimate interest vital to protecting all users, and a user's reasonable expectation is that such data would be processed for platform integrity.

                    While these rights are fundamental, their implementation is not absolute. For instance, the "Right to Erasure" may be overridden by a legal obligation to retain data (e.g., financial records for tax purposes) or if the data is required for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. A robust privacy policy must manage user expectations by clarifying these limitations.
